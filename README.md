## What is this?


**Weathering With You** is a weather web app to get the current weather data of the zip code you submit into the form.
 Consists of 4 main components
 - the header at the top
 - the form to input your zipcode, choose the temperature metric, and save button
 - [left-hand panel] Display weather data
 - [right-hand panel] 10 most recent weather data queries

## Setup
Prereq apps to have downloaded
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/JinKim7/mern-weather-app.git
```

Download all npm packages for both client/server
```javascript
npm run setup
```

### .env file
Need two creds. Weather api and mongo connection string

#### Mongo
Log into [mongo](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)

On the left-hand sidebar, you should see **Database Access**. Click on it and make a new user for yourself.  
1. Click on `Add New Database User`
2. Create a new user by filling out `username` and `password`  
(this will be different creds than your actual mongo account. This is gives a user access to this particular database.)

On the left-hand sidebar, you should see **Network Access**.  
Make a new access point for your IP address to get permission on using your mongodb.

Now create a `.env` file in your root directory of `mern-weather-app` and dynamically add this to your `.env`
```javascript
DB=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-id>.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
To get the cluster ID, go to **Clusters** and click on **Connect > Connect your application** to get a more detailed view of how the DB string should look like. 

#### Weather API
Make an account at   and go to the [api keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) section.
Copy/pasta that key to the .env file using `WEATHER_KEY` as your key
```
WEATHER_KEY=1234567890asdfjkl
```

## Run Locally

```

You can now run your local.  
Go to your root directory and start your web app:
```javascript
npm run dev
```
